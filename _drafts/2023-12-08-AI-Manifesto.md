# My Personal AI Manifesto

My intend here is not to present any novel ideas or unique vision for the future (of AI). Rather, this is a, hopefully concise, write-up of the what, why and how of the path forward for AI as I see it. Everything I say will have been said by someone else before, probably 50 years ago. The purpose of this post is simply to (a) help me clarify my thoughts for my own sake, and (b) to have something to hand to other people to figure out whether our goals align or not.


## What do we want, and why?

To me there is only really one sensible reason to build AI, that being true automation, the delegation of all labour to machines. After all, that's why we began building machines in the first place, be it because a machine is stronger, more precise, or just capable of taking over menial work we don't want to do.
