# They/None/Any

This is a permissive ordered cross-lingual pronoun preference list.

**They:** If a given language has an "epicene" (gender-neutral) third-person pronoun, like the English singular "they", then this is the preferred way to be referred to in third person.

**None:** If a given language does not have an epicene third-person pronoun, but it's grammar allows for sentences without any third-person pronouns, like in Japanese, then this is the preferred way to be referred to in third person.

**Any:** If a given language does neither have an epicene third-person pronoun, nor allows for not using any third-person pronouns at all, then any animate third-person pronoun, like "sie" or "er" in German, is okay to be referred to in third person.

**Permissive:** If a person is not comfortable with or not used to using a epicene third-person pronoun or speaking without the use of pronouns in a given language, then it is preferred for the person to rather use a less preferred way of reference, than for the person to refrain from speaking or to be agitated. Trying to use more preferred ways of reference is however encouraged.
